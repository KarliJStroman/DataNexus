# DataNexus Pro

Do you have convoluted data in Smartsheets - or other business management applications - ? Do you want to use that data to drive your business decisions but can't manage to get it into the right format? What about your clients, vendors, employees, or business partners? Are they posing problems or asking questions you can't answer, but know you could if you could manage to extract the information that you've carefully been tracking for so long? DataNexus Pro is the answer. 
Our intuitive app seamlessly converts .xlsx files from Samrtsheets, Microsoft Office, Wrike, and more into dynamic, easy-to-use visualizations. Simply upload your file, select the fields you want to correlate, and we'll show you the newly formatted data in a way that's easy to understand and use. 




<!-- Tell us what you want to see and we'll show you. Our simple interface will help you find the data you need, and we'll provide you with multiple forms in which to view and/or present it.  -->
